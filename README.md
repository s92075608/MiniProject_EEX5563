# Best Fit Memory Allocation

This project demonstrates the Best Fit algorithm for memory allocation, simulating the process of dynamically allocating memory to processes using the Best Fit strategy.

## Purpose

The Best Fit Memory Allocation algorithm allocates each process to the smallest memory block that can accommodate it. This method minimizes wasted space in memory, but it may result in fragmentation.

## Files

- `main.py`: Main script to run the memory allocation simulation.
- `allocation.py`: Contains the Best Fit algorithm logic.
- `test.py`: Unit tests to verify the correctness of the algorithm.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
